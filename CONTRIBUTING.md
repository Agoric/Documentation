## Current intention

The current work aims at creating a progressive learning experience into writing Smart Contracts as proposed by Agoric. An attention is given to provide a very simple first experience and increase the complexity gradually

Identified sources of complexity:
- How contracts can be expressed
    - Jessie
- What can be expressed in contracts
    - multi-party contracts with invites
    - turn-based contracts
    - ERTP framework
        - ContractHost
        - Escrow
    - CoveredCall
    - hierarchical rights
    - non-determinism (time, randomness)?
- Infrastructure/Tooling
    - @agoric npm packages
    - User interface
    - Vats
    - Swingset
    - Cosmic-Swingset
