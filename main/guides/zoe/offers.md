# Invitations and Offers

You must have a Zoe **[Invitation](/reference/zoe-api/zoe-data-types.md#invitation)** to a specific contract instance to join
and participate in it. Let's imagine your friend Alice has sent you an
**Invitation** for a contract instance to your [wallet](/guides/wallet/).

Compare this to a smart contract on *Ethereum*. On *Ethereum*, the smart
contract developer must guard against malicious calls and store an
internal access control list to check whether the message sender is
allowed to send such a message. Zoe, built on Agoric's [object
capability](/glossary/#object-capabilities) security model, is significantly
easier.

## Invitations

**[Invitations](/reference/zoe-api/zoe-data-types.md#invitation)** are a special case of ERTP **[Payments](/reference/ertp-api/payment.md)**. They are linked to a specific contract **[Instance](/reference/zoe-api/zoe-data-types.md#instance)**, and
having one gives you the right to participate in that contract **Instance**, for example, by making offers in it.

There are two main ways for contract users to get an **Invitation**:
- If you create the contract **Instance**, you get a special creator **Invitation**.
- Someone (possibly you) who holds the right objects has created an **Invitation** for a contract **Instance** and gives it to
  you in some way. This could've been by sending it to you, posting it on a public online location, etc. It
  doesn't matter (nor does Zoe specify or have any requirements) how or why it got to you, only that you have it.

## Inspecting An Invitation

Before you use any **[Invitation](/reference/zoe-api/zoe-data-types.md#invitation)**, you should 
always first inspect and validate the **Invitation**.

<<< @/snippets/test-intro-zoe.js#details

::: warning Note

E() is part of the Agoric platform and is used to [call methods on
remote objects and receive a promise for the
result](/guides/js-programming/eventual-send.md).
Code on the Agoric platform is put in separate environments, called
[vats](/glossary/#vat), for security. Zoe is a remote object in its own vat,
so we must use E().
:::

Invitations include information about their contract's installation.
Essentially, this is the contract's source code as installed on Zoe.
From this overall contract installation, people use Zoe to create and
run specific instances of the contract. For example, if a real estate
company has a contract for selling a house, they would create an
instance of the contract for each individual house they have up for
sale.

You use object identity comparison to quickly check that you recognize
this contract installation, without having to compare source code
line-by-line. If the installation matches, you're
sure the invitation is for participating in an instance of the
expected contract rather than an unknown and possibly malicious one.

<<< @/snippets/test-intro-zoe.js#isCorrectCode

However, if you don't recognize the installation, you can inspect its
code directly by calling:

<<< @/snippets/test-intro-zoe.js#inspectCode

In most cases, the bundle contains a base64-encoded zip file that you can
extract for review:
```sh
echo "$endoZipBase64" | base64 -d > bundle.zip
unzip bundle.zip
```

Contracts can add their own specific information to invitations. In
this case, the Atomic Swap contract adds information about what is
being traded: the `asset` **[Amount](/reference/ertp-api/ertp-data-types.md#amount)**
Alice has escrowed, and the `price` **Amount** that you must pay to get it.
Note that both are _descriptions_ of digital assets with no intrinsic value of their own.

## Making an Offer

To make an offer, you use **[E(zoe).offer()](/reference/zoe-api/zoe.md#e-zoe-offer-invitation-proposal-paymentkeywordrecord-offerargs)**, which takes three arguments:
- An **[Invitation](/reference/zoe-api/zoe-data-types.md#invitation)** to participate in this contract instance.
- A **Proposal** stating your offer conditions.
- The **[Payments](/reference/ertp-api/payment.md)** escrowed for the offer, each in association with a `proposal`-specified keyword.



## Proposals

Proposals are records with **give**, **want**, and **exit** keys.

```js
const myProposal = harden({
  give: { Asset: AmountMath.make(quatloosBrand, 4n)},
  want: { Price: AmountMath.make(moolaBrand, 15n) },
  exit: { onDemand: null },
})
```
**give** and **want** use keywords defined by the contract.
Keywords are unique identifiers per contract, that tie together the proposal,
payments to be escrowed, and payouts to the user.
In the example above, **Asset** and **Price** are the keywords. However, in an auction contract,
the keywords might be **Asset** and **Bid**.

The `AmountMath.make(quatloosBrand, 4n)` is just making an ERTP `amount`, or description of digital assets.
In this case, 4 of our imaginary *Quatloos* currency. `AmountMath.make(moolaBrand, 15n)` is making 
an `amount` of 15 of our imaginary *Moola* currency. (The appended "n" indicates that the numbers are
represented as `BigInts` rather than `Numbers`)

**Note**: It's important to understand that `amounts` are just descriptions of assets with no
intrinsic value. `payments` hold actual digital assets.

`exit` determines how an offer can be can cancelled:
- `onDemand: null`: (Default) The offering party can cancel on demand.
- `waived: null`: The offering party can't cancel and relies entirely on the smart contract to promptly finish their offer.
- `afterDeadline: {â€¦}`: The offer is automatically cancelled after a deadline,
  as determined by its `timer` and `deadline` properties. See
  [Proposals and payments](/reference/zoe-api/zoe.md#proposals-and-payments).

## Escrowed Payments

Using the same keywords as your `proposal`, you must specify a `PaymentKeywordRecord`.
This is a record with the keywords as keys, and `payments` containing digital assets as
values. Zoe escrows these `payments` on behalf of this offer until the offer is completed
or rejected or the assets are reassigned to another offer. 
```js
const paymentKeywordRecord = { 
  'Asset' : quatloosPayment, 
  'Price' : moolaPayment 
};
```
## Returned Value

`offer()` returns a `UserSeat` object. Its name comes from the concept of "having a seat at the table" 
for the contract's execution.
