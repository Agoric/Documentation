**NOTE: You almost certainly do not want to use this contract directly.
Instead, please read the [Chainlink integration
documentation](/guides/chainlink-integration.md)**

This contract lets other contracts or users make single free or fee-based
queries to a generic oracle node (a single instance).  This provides a very
low-level API to issue single queries that an individual off-chain oracle node
answers.

**CAUTION: The security of oracle networks (such as Chainlink) depends upon
having higher-level contracts to aggregate the results of the individual nodes
(this low-level contract).  This protects against misbehaviour from an
individual node.**

Relying on just a single node can be both expensive and risky. Instead, use the
higher-level APIs described in the [Chainlink integration
documentation](/guides/chainlink-integration.md).

## Making a Free Query

To make a free query, obtain the `publicFacet` for the oracle contract
instance.

<<< @/snippets/zoe/contracts/test-oracle.js#freeQuery

The `query` that is passed in could be in any format that the
oracle accepts. The response can be in any format, as the oracle determines.

## Making a Paid Query

To make a query that requires payment, obtain the `publicFacet` as
before, but this time, make a `queryInvitation`. Use the
`queryInvitation` to make an offer and escrow the required payments in
the `Fee` brand. The response will be the result of your offer.

<<< @/snippets/zoe/contracts/test-oracle.js#paidQuery

## Instantiating a New Oracle Contract

If you want to create your own oracle contract instance, first bundle
and install the code if it is not already installed.

<<< @/snippets/zoe/contracts/test-oracle.js#bundle

Then start the contract instance. You will receive a `publicFacet` and
a `creatorFacet`.

<<< @/snippets/zoe/contracts/test-oracle.js#startInstance

You will need to use the creatorFacet to initialize an
`oracleHandler`. The `oracleHandler` is what will actually be queried,
so we do not want to put it in the contract terms, which are publicly
accessible.

<<< @/snippets/zoe/contracts/test-oracle.js#initialize

## The Oracle Handler API

The contract expects all `oracleHandlers` to offer the following API:
