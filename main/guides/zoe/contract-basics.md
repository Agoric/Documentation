# Smart Contract Basics

This guide is designed to help developers understand how to write smart contracts efficiently and securely. Here, you will find detailed examples that demonstrate different functionalities and use-cases within the context of smart contracts starting from the very basics.

## Examples

We provide three core examples to illustrate how to implement various smart contract functionalities:

### 1. Greetings Contract
The **Greetings Contract** demonstrates how to create a simple contract that greets the caller. This example is perfect for understanding the basic structure and syntax of smart contracts.

### 2. State Contract
The **State Contract** shows how to maintain a state or a variable within a smart contract. This is useful for contracts that need to store data or state across transactions.

### 3. Access-Control Contract
The **Access-Control Contract** provides an example of how to implement access control, ensuring that only authorized users can call certain functions within the smart contract.
