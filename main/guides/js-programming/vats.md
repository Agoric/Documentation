# Vats

A vat is a *unit of isolation*. To paraphrase the Las Vegas advertising slogan, what happens in the vat stays in the vat. Objects and functions in a JavaScript vat can communicate synchronously with one another. Vats and their contents can communicate with other vats and their objects and functions, but have to
[manage asynchronous messages and responses](/guides/js-programming/eventual-send.md).

There are no tools for telling what vat something is in, or if two things are in the same or different vats. In general, you/your code should know if things are local (in the same vat) because you created them or they were passed to you by something guaranteeing thatâ€™s the case. Other objects you should treat as if they might be distant (in different vats). In practice, you will know that your normal method calls (`obj.method()`) fails because the method doesn't exist and that's usually when you slap your forehead and go "Of course, it's remote! I needed to call `E(obj).method()`.

Vats need to run on some platform. Both a single physical machine and a blockchain (which might itself be running on a set of collaborating machines) are possible platforms. Either type of platform can host one or more vats.

Since a vat runs in a single *event loop*, each incoming request has to finish before the next one starts. If there's remaining work, you schedule it to happen later after a Promise resolves.

The Agoric process starts several vats. Each vat hosts a service (e.g. the Board, Zoe,
etc.). As of March, 2021, all contracts each run in a new vat with their own version of the 
Zoe Contract Facet. There is one vat that contains the Zoe Service.
