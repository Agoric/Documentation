# UI Tutorial

In this tutorial you will build your own UI from scratch. Along the way, you'll learn how to connect to a wallet, query the blockchain and smart contract state, sign transactions, and more!

## Prerequisites

See [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md) first to get your environment, including a local chain, up and running. This tutorial will walk through, from start to finish, how to build a UI for the "Offer Up" dapp as seen in that example.
