## Conclusion

Throughout this tutorial, you've accomplished all the basics of building an Agoric Dapp UI:

- Scaffolding a new React App.
- Setting up `AgoricProvider` and connecting to a wallet.
- Reading and rendering purse balances.
- Reading contract data with `chainStorageWatcher`.
- Making an offer to exchange some on-chain assets.

With these basics in place, the world of Agoric UI development has opened up to you. To expand on your
newly acquired knowledge, consider trying out the following tasks:

- Spruce up your UI with `interchain-ui` components and try customizing the theme.
- Add automated e2e testing using https://github.com/agoric-labs/synpress
- Add a new item to the "Offer Up" contract and implement UI support for it.
- Deploy the contract to a testnet and adding the `NetworkDropdown` component to your dapp to switch between networks.
- Write your own dapp and implement a custom UI for it.
