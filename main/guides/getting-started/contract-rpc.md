# Smart Wallet Dapp Architecture

The [Agoric Platform](../platform/) consists of smart contracts
and services such as [Zoe](../zoe/) running in a [Hardened JavaScript](../js-programming/hardened-js.md) VM running on top of a Cosmos SDK consensus layer. Clients interact with the consensus layer by making
queries and submitting messages in signed transactions. In the Smart
Wallet Architecture, dapps consist of

- Hardened JavaScript smart contracts
- clients that can submit offers and query status via the consensus layer

![smart wallet dapp sequence diagram](./assets/sw-dapp-arch.svg)

1. A client formats an offer, signs it, and broadcasts it.
2. The offer is routed to the `walletFactory` contract, which finds (or creates) the `smartWallet` object associated with the signer's addres and uses it to execute the offer.
3. The `smartWallet` calls `E(zoe).offer(...)` and monitors the status of
   the offer, emitting it for clients to query.
4. Zoe escrows the payments and forwards the proposal to the contract
   indicated by the offer.
5. The contract tells Zoe how to reallocate assets.
6. Zoe ensures that the reallocations respect offer safety and then provides payouts accordingly.
7. The client's query tells it that the payouts are available.

## Signing and Broadcasting Offers

One way to sign and broadcast offers is with the `agd tx ...` command. For example:

```sh
agd tx swingset wallet-action --allow-spend "$ACTION" \
 --chain-id=agoriclocal --from=acct1
```

<!-- TODO: discuss agoric wallet send? -->

Another is using a wallet signing UI such as Keplr via the [Keplr API](https://docs.keplr.app/api/).

Given sufficient care with key management, a [cosmjs SigningStargateClient](https://cosmos.github.io/cosmjs/latest/stargate/classes/SigningStargateClient.html) or any other client that can deliver a [agoric.swingset.MsgWalletSpendAction](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/mainnet1B/golang/cosmos/proto/agoric/swingset/msgs.proto#L70) to a
[Cosmos SDK endpoint](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/core/grpc_rest) works.

```proto
message MsgWalletSpendAction {
    bytes owner = 1;
    string spend_action = 2;
}
```

<!-- TODO: owner field, toAccAddress, base64. working example -->

## Querying VStorage

[VStorage](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/golang/cosmos/x/vstorage#readme) (for "Virtual Storage") is a key-value store that is
read-only for clients of the consensus layer.
From within the JavaScript VM, it is accessed via a `chainStorage` API with a node at each
key that is write-only; a bit like a `console`.

![vstorage query diagram](./assets/vstorage-brand-q.svg)

The protobuf definition is [agoric.vstorage.Query](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/mainnet1B/golang/cosmos/proto/agoric/vstorage/query.proto#L11):

```proto
service Query {
  // Return an arbitrary vstorage datum.
  rpc Data(QueryDataRequest) returns (QueryDataResponse) {
    option (google.api.http).get = "/agoric/vstorage/data/{path}";
  }

  // Return the children of a given vstorage path.
  rpc Children(QueryChildrenRequest)
    returns (QueryChildrenResponse) {
      option (google.api.http).get = "/agoric/vstorage/children/{path}";
  }
}
```

We can issue queries using, `agd query ...`:

```sh
$ agd query vstorage children 'published.agoricNames'

children:
- brand
- installation
- instance
...
```

The [Agoric CLI](../agoric-cli/) `follow` command supports vstorage
query plus some of the marshalling conventions discussed below:

```sh
$ agoric follow -lF :published.agoricNames.brand
[
  [
    "BLD",
    slotToVal("board0566","Alleged: BLD brand"),
  ],
  [
    "IST",
    slotToVal("board0257","Alleged: IST brand"),
  ],
...
]
```

## Specifying Offers

Recall that for an agent within the JavaScript VM,
[E(zoe).offer(...)](../../reference/zoe-api/zoe.md#e-zoe-offer-invitation-proposal-paymentkeywordrecord-offerargs) takes an `Invitation` and optionally a `Proposal` with `{ give, want }`, a `PaymentPKeywordRecord`, and `offerArgs`; it returns a `UserSeat` from which we can [getPayouts()](../../reference/zoe-api/user-seat.md#e-userseat-getpayouts).

![Zoe API diagram, simplified](./assets/zoe-simp.svg)

In the Smart Wallet architecture, a client uses an `OfferSpec` to
tell its `SmartWallet` how to conduct an offer.
It includes an `invitationSpec` to say what invitation to pass to Zoe. For example:

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#exInvitationSpec

Here the `SmartWallet` calls `E(zoe).getPublicFacet(instance)` and then
uses the `publicInvitationMaker` and `invitationArgs` to call the contract's
public facet.

![InvitationSpec sequence diagram](./assets/inv-spec.svg)

<!-- TODO: SVG diagram in /assets/ -->

::: tip InvitationSpec Patterns
For more `InvitationSpec` examples, see [How to make an offer from a dapp via the smart wallet? \(InvitationSpec Patterns\) Â· #8082](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/discussions/8082) July 2023
:::

The client fills in the proposal, which instructs the `SmartWallet`
to withdraw corresponding payments to send to Zoe.

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#exBridgeAction

But recall the `spend_action` field in `MsgWalletSpendAction` is a string.
In fact, the expected string in this case is of the form:

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#exSpendActionCk

We recognize `"method":"executeOffer"` and such, but
`body:`, `slots:`, and `$1.Alleged: Gold Brand` need further explanation.

### Marshalling Amounts and Instances

::: tip Watch: Office Hours Discussion of Marshal

- [Office Hours: ... marshalling w/board ids, ... \#8069](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/discussions/8069) July 2023

:::

To start with, amounts include `bigint`s. The `@endo/marshal` API handles those:

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#marshal-json-steroids

To marshal brands and instances, recall from the discussion of [marshal in eventual send](../js-programming/eventual-send.md#e-and-marshal-a-closer-look)
how remotables are marshalled with a translation table.

The [Agoric Board](../../reference/repl/board.md) is a well-known name service that issues
plain string identifiers for object identities and other passable _keys_ (that is: passable values excluding promises and errors).
Contracts and other services can use its table of identifiers as a marshal
translation table:

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#boardMarshal

To reverse the process, clients can mirror the on-chain board translation
table by synthesizing a remotable for each reference marker received:

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#makeBoardContext

Now we can take results of vstorage queries for `Data('published.agoricNames.brand')` and `Data('published.agoricNames.instance')` unmarshal ("ingest") them:

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#useBoardContext

And now we have all the pieces of the `BridgeAction` above.
The marshalled form is:

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#exBridgeActionEq

We still don't quite have a single string for the `spend_action` field.
We need to `stringify` the `CapData`:

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#exSpendAction

And now we have the `spend_action` in the expected form:

<<< @/snippets/test-marshal.js#exSpendActionCk

The wallet factory can now `JSON.parse` this string
into `CapData` and unmarshal it using a board marshaller
to convert board ids back into brands, instances, etc.

## Smart Wallet VStorage Topics

Each smart wallet has a node under `published.wallet`:

```sh
$ agd query vstorage children published.wallet
children:
- agoric1h4d3mdvyqhy2vnw2shq4pm5duz5u8wa33jy6cl
- agoric1qx2kqqdk80fdasldzkqu86tg4rhtaufs00na3y
- agoric1rhul0rxa2z829a6xkrvuq8m8wjwekyduv7dzfj
...
```

Smart wallet clients should start by getting the **current** state
at `published.${ADDRESS}.current` and then subscribe to **updates**
at `published.${ADDRESS}`. For example, we can use `agoric follow -lF`
to get the latest `.current` record:

```sh
$ agoric follow -lF :published.wallet.agoric1h4d3mdvyqhy2vnw2shq4pm5duz5u8wa33jy6cl.current
{
  liveOffers: [],
  offerToPublicSubscriberPaths: [
    [
      "openVault-1691526589332",
      {
        vault: "published.vaultFactory.managers.manager0.vaults.vault2",
      },
    ],
  ],
  offerToUsedInvitation: [
    [
      "openVault-1691526589332",
      {
        brand: slotToVal("board0074","Alleged: Zoe Invitation brand"),
        value: [
          {
            description: "manager0: MakeVault",
            handle: slotToVal(null,"Alleged: InvitationHandle"),
            installation: slotToVal("board05815","Alleged: BundleIDInstallation"),
            instance: slotToVal("board00360","Alleged: InstanceHandle"),
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  ],
  purses: [
    {
      balance: {
        brand: slotToVal("board0074"),
        value: [],
      },
      brand: slotToVal("board0074"),
    },
  ],
}
```

Then we can use `agoric follow` without any options to
get a stream of updates as they appear.

```sh
agoric follow :published.wallet.agoric1h4d3mdvyqhy2vnw2shq4pm5duz5u8wa33jy6cl
...
{
  status: {
    id: "closeVault-1691526597848",
    invitationSpec: {
      invitationMakerName: "CloseVault",
      previousOffer: "openVault-1691526589332",
      source: "continuing",
    },
    numWantsSatisfied: 1,
    payouts: {
      Collateral: {
        brand: slotToVal("board05557","Alleged: ATOM brand"),
        value: 13000000n,
      },
      Minted: {
        brand: slotToVal("board0257","Alleged: IST brand"),
        value: 215000n,
      },
    },
    proposal: {
      give: {
        Minted: {
          brand: slotToVal("board0257"),
          value: 5750000n,
        },
      },
      want: {},
    },
    result: "your vault is closed, thank you for your business",
  },
  updated: "offerStatus",
}
```

Note that status updates are emitted at several points in the handling of
each offer:

- when the `getOfferResult()` promise settles
- when the `numWantsSatisfied()` promise settles
- when the payouts have been deposited.

And we may get `balance` updates at any time.

The data published via vstorage are available within the JavaScript VM
via the [getPublicTopics](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/mainnet1B/packages/smart-wallet/src/smartWallet.js#L585) API.

The [CurrentWalletRecord](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/mainnet1B/packages/smart-wallet/src/smartWallet.js#L71-L76) type is:

```ts
{
   purses: Array<{brand: Brand, balance: Amount}>,
   offerToUsedInvitation: Array<[ offerId: string, usedInvitation: Amount ]>,
   offerToPublicSubscriberPaths: Array<[ offerId: string, publicTopics: { [subscriberName: string]: string } ]>,
   liveOffers: Array<[import('./offers.js').OfferId, import('./offers.js').OfferStatus]>,
}
```

And [UpdateRecord](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/mainnet1B/packages/smart-wallet/src/smartWallet.js#L80-L83) is:

```ts
     { updated: 'offerStatus', status: import('./offers.js').OfferStatus }
   | { updated: 'balance'; currentAmount: Amount }
   | { updated: 'walletAction'; status: { error: string } }
```

Both of those types include [OfferStatus](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/mainnet1B/packages/smart-wallet/src/offers.js#L21C14-L26C5) by reference:

```ts
import('./offers.js').OfferSpec & {
 error?: string,
 numWantsSatisfied?: number
 result?: unknown | typeof UNPUBLISHED_RESULT,
 payouts?: AmountKeywordRecord,
}
```

## VBank Assets and Cosmos Bank Balances

Note that balances of assets such as **IST** and **BLD** are already
available via consensus layer queries to the Cosmos SDK [bank module](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/bank).

```sh
$ agd query bank balances agoric1h4d3mdvyqhy2vnw2shq4pm5duz5u8wa33jy6cl -o json | jq .balances
[
  {
    "denom": "ibc/BA313C4A19DFBF943586C0387E6B11286F9E416B4DD27574E6909CABE0E342FA",
    "amount": "100000000"
  },
  {
    "denom": "ubld",
    "amount": "10000000"
  },
  {
    "denom": "uist",
    "amount": "215000"
  }
]
```

They are not published redundantly in vstorage and nor does the
smart wallet emit `balance` updates for them.

To get the correspondence between certain cosmos denoms (chosen by governance)
and their ERTP brands, issuers, and display info such as `decimalPlaces`,
see `published.agoricNames.vbankAsset`:

```sh
agoric follow -lF :published.agoricNames.vbankAsset
[
  [
    "ibc/BA313C4A19DFBF943586C0387E6B11286F9E416B4DD27574E6909CABE0E342FA",
    {
      brand: slotToVal("board05557","Alleged: ATOM brand"),
      denom: "ibc/BA313C4A19DFBF943586C0387E6B11286F9E416B4DD27574E6909CABE0E342FA",
      displayInfo: {
        assetKind: "nat",
        decimalPlaces: 6,
      },
      issuer: slotToVal("board02656","Alleged: ATOM issuer"),
      issuerName: "ATOM",
      proposedName: "ATOM",
    },
  ],
  [
    "ubld",
    {
      brand: slotToVal("board0566","Alleged: BLD brand"),
      denom: "ubld",
      displayInfo: {
        assetKind: "nat",
        decimalPlaces: 6,
      },
      issuer: slotToVal("board0592","Alleged: BLD issuer"),
      issuerName: "BLD",
      proposedName: "Agoric staking token",
    },
  ],
  [
    "uist",
    {
      brand: slotToVal("board0257","Alleged: IST brand"),
      denom: "uist",
      displayInfo: {
        assetKind: "nat",
        decimalPlaces: 6,
      },
      issuer: slotToVal("board0223","Alleged: IST issuer"),
      issuerName: "IST",
      proposedName: "Agoric stable token",
    },
  ],
...
]
```
