#### A note on syncing from genesis

Syncing from genesis requires a significant amount of time (upwards of a week). If you desire to start up a node quicker than that, however without all transaction history, consider using a snapshot from the community. e.g. from [dsrv](https://www.allthatnode.com/agoric.dsrv), [polkachu](https://www.polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots/agoric), or others.

### agoric-3.1

1. `git clone https://github.com/Agoric/ag0.git && cd ag0`
1. `git checkout tags/agoric-3.1`
1. `make install`
1. `ag0 init follow --chain-id agoric-3`
1. `curl https://main.rpc.agoric.net/genesis | jq .result.genesis > $HOME/.agoric/config/genesis.json`
1. `ag0 start`

   chain will halt at 3,565,000

### agoric-upgrade-5

1. `git clone https://github.com/Agoric/ag0.git; cd ag0 && git checkout tags/agoric-upgrade-5`
1. `make install`
1. `ag0 start`

   chain will halt at 5,901,622

### agoric-upgrade-6

1. `git clone https://github.com/Agoric/ag0.git; cd ag0 && git checkout tags/agoric-upgrade-6`
1. `make install`
1. `ag0 start`

   chain will halt at 6,263,783

### agoric-upgrade-7-2

agoric-upgrade-7-2 is a agoric-upgrade-7 compatible soft-patch, and can be used in place of agoric-upgrade-7. This soft-patch includes the dragonberry security updates.

1. `git clone https://github.com/Agoric/ag0.git; cd ag0 && git checkout tags/agoric-upgrade-7-2`
1. `make install`
1. `ag0 start`

   chain will halt at 7,179,262

### note about ag0 -> agd

The `agd` upgrade starts now, and you need to ensure you have
nodejs 16+ LTS installed, along with any dependencies mentioned
in https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/README.md

This guide assumes you've git cloned the agoric-sdk from
https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/ to a folder
named `agoric-sdk` and you've installed the required dependencies
noted in the readme.

### agoric-upgrade-8

1. `git clone https://github.com/agoric/agoric-sdk.git; cd agoric-sdk && git checkout tags/agoric-upgrade-8`
1. `yarn install && yarn build`
1. `(cd packages/cosmic-swingset && make)`
1. `agd start`

After more than 10 blocks have successfully synced, stop the `agd` process
and update to `agoric-upgrade-8-1`, a soft upgrade. This soft upgrade includes
logic to handle a memory condition that may lead to your node falling out of consensus.
It is recommended to upgrade to `agoric-upgrade-8-1` as soon as you have successfully
produced a handful of blocks with the `agoric-upgrade-8` upgrade.

### agoric-upgrade-8-1

1. `git clone https://github.com/agoric/agoric-sdk.git; agoric-sdk && git checkout tags/agoric-upgrade-8-1`
1. `yarn install && yarn build`
1. `(cd packages/cosmic-swingset && make)`
1. `agd start`

### agoric-upgrade-9

#### Current Community Snapshot

The `agoric-upgrade-9` release requires Go version 1.18 or higher.

1. `git clone https://github.com/agoric/agoric-sdk.git; agoric-sdk && git checkout tags/agoric-upgrade-9`
1. `yarn install && yarn build`
1. `(cd packages/cosmic-swingset && make)`
1. `agd start`
