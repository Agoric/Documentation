# Installation and Deployment

The dApp implements a smart contract that can be installed and deployed on any Agoric testnet. Since, the contract interacts with remote chains, we need to a multichain environment - see [Agoric Multichain-Testing]() for details. Follow in the instructions in [dApp Readme]() to install, deploy and interact with the dApp on your local machine.
