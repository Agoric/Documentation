# dApp Orchestration Basics

To get started with developing using the Orchestration API, developers can make use of our [dapp-orchestration-basics](https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-orchestration-basics) template.

Following the dApp pattern of our existing dapp templates, `dapp-orchestration-basics` contains both ui & contract folders within a single yarn workspace.
