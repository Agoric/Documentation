The Orchestration Basics dApp demonstrates key features of the orchestration API within a fully functional end-to-end environment. The user interface enables interaction with the orchestration components from client-side javascript.

## Setting Up the Local Environment

To set up your local environment, refer to the `agoric-sdk/multichain-testing/README.md` for detailed setup instructions. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key steps:

Once it is setup, you want to be able to run:
```console
kubectl get pods
```

We expect to see an output like this:

```console
NAME                       READY   STATUS     RESTARTS      AGE
agoriclocal-genesis-0      1/2     Running    0             68s
gaialocal-genesis-0        2/3     Running    0             68s
hermes-agoric-gaia-0       2/2     Running    0             68s
hermes-agoric-osmosis-0    2/2     Running    0             68s
hermes-osmosis-gaia-0      2/2     Running    0             68s
osmosislocal-genesis-0     3/3     Running    0             68s
registry-79cf44b64-xct5b   1/1     Running    0             68s
```

This assures us that our environment with the following resources is running:
- an Agoric node
- a Gaia node
- an Osmosis node
- an Agoric <-> Gaia hermes relayer
- an Agoric <-> Osmosis hermes relayer

**Check Agoric Daemon Status**  
Verify that the Agoric daemon is running with the following command:
```bash
agd status
```
If the daemon isn't reachable, but the node is running, you may need to make sure the ports are forwarded properly. You can do this by running this command from inside `multichain-testing/`:

```bash
make port-forward
```


### Overriding the Chain Registry for use with `agoric-sdk/multichain-testing`

To use this dapp with the kubernetes environment spun-up by `multchain-testing` & starship, we have to make sure vstorage reflects the chain information relevent to our locally-maintained environment. 

Run the following commands from the `agoric-sdk/multichain-testing/` directory:

```bash
make override-chain-registry
```

## Multichain-Testing Makefile Helpers
To streamline your workflow, you can add the following commands to the bottom of your `multichain-testing/Makefile`:

```makefile
teardown: stop-forward stop clean delete

corepack-setup:
	corepack prepare yarn@4 --activate

corepack-enable:
	corepack enable

test:
	yarn test test/install-contracts.test.ts

all: setup install
	sleep 3
	make port-forward
	sleep 120
	make fund-provision-pool
	sleep 10
	make add-address
	echo "done running"

hermes-update:
	kubectl exec -i hermes-agoric-osmosis-0 -c relayer -- hermes update client --host-chain agoriclocal --client 07-tendermint-1 # or 07-tendermint-0
	sleep 60
	make hermes-update
```

**Restart the Environment**  
If you need to restart your environment for any reason, use the following command from `agoric-sdk/multichain-testing`:
```bash
make teardown ; make stop; make stop-forward; make clean; make; make port-forward
```

## Adding a New Address

Before deploying the contract, we want to generate a new address using the keyring inside of the localchain environment. To add a new address to the keychain inside the Kubernetes pod, run the following command from the top-level directory:

```bash
make add-address
```

Now, inside of `contract/`, paste the resulting `agoric1` prefixed address into the `Makefile` under the `ADDR`variable.

## Funding the Account

To now fund the account we just generated, we run the following command from the top-level directory. 

```bash
make fund
```

This funds the pool, provisions the smart wallet, and also funds `CLIENTADDR` and `CLIENT_OSMO_ADDR`. You can use `CLIENTADDR` and `CLIENT_OSMO_ADDR` to set your browser wallet addreses that you would like to fund during this step.

**CLIENTADDR:** Your browser wallet address for interacting with the orchestration dApp.

**CLIENT_OSMO_ADDR:** Your Osmosis account address.

## Building & Deploying the dApp

To build and deploy the dApp, run the following command from the top-level directory:

```bash
make
```

This is a convenient step that will build, and deploy `/contract/src/orca.contract.js`, using `scripts/deploy-contract.js`.


## Running Tests

To run tests, use the following commands from the top-level directory:

```bash
make test-orca
```

For more on testing the project, [see here](/guides/orchestration/dapp-orchestration-basics/testing):


## End-to-End Build & Deploy

For an end-to-end build and deploy, use the following command if the contract deployment fails -- this will simply retry submitting the proposal:

```bash
make redeploy
```

## Funding on Osmosis (for testing)

To fund an account on Osmosis for any reason, we can get access to the node's environment with this command:

```console
kubectl -it osmosislocal-genesis-0 -- bash
```

and now we are inside the container, and can interact with the keychain accounts, etc. For example, we can now look at the accounts in the keychain, without having to have the osmosis executable on our local filesystem directly. 

```console
osmosisd keys list
[{"name":"faucet","type":"local","address":"osmo1vhdew4wqu3tp8l2d55aqcc73aqvr0rr9vdxded","pubkey":"{\"@type\":\"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey\",\"key\":\"A5fdOBMxJrfNN0qRmA+Ewzamh1u/4AA1eKhEJHp+lWXr\"}"},{"name":"genesis","type":"local","address":"osmo1qjtcxl86z0zua2egcsz4ncff2gzlcndz2jeczk","pubkey":"{\"@type\":\"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey\",\"key\":\"AmPsa3aqarITEk9NM7T9guOi9VdyrHkqEdqVABLIcDew\"}"}]osmosislocal-genesis-0:/opt# 
```


use the following command to fund any address from the faucet account:

```console
osmosisd tx bank send faucet osmo1dw3nep8yqy5szzxn6hmma6j2z77vp4wz8tkh0w3gyrruwny0w03s070kaa 299999999uosmo --chain-id osmosislocal --gas-adjustment 2 --gas auto --from faucet --gas-prices 0.0025uosmo
```

## Example RPC query for Balances

To query balances via RPC, use the following URL structure:

```console
http://127.0.0.1:26657/abci_query?path=%22/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.Query/AllBalances%22&data=%22%5Cn-agoric12j5kzvrwunqvrga5vm4zpy3mkeh3lvyld0amz5%22
```

## Temporary Funding of ICA

To temporarily fund an ICA, use the following command for example:

```console
agd tx bank send keplr1 agoric15ch7da0d8nvqc8hk6dguq4ext0lvskpjcwm3patf8sygm63chmpqjlzt74 1000uist -y --chain-id agoriclocal
```

This is just a native bank transfer of **1000IST** (`uist`) to an arbitrary account using `agd`
