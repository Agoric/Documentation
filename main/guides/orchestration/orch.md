# Orchestration in Blockchain Ecosystems

Blockchain technology has ushered in an era of decentralized finance, governance, and communication. However, as the ecosystem expands with numerous blockchains specializing in different aspects of decentralized applications, the need for coordination among these disparate networks becomes evident. This is where orchestration plays a vital role. In this blog post, we'll dive deep into what orchestration is, why it's essential, and how it works, especially in the context of the Agoric blockchain.

## What is Orchestration?

Orchestration in the blockchain context refers to the automated coordination and management of interactions between different blockchain networks. Just as an orchestra requires a conductor to synchronize the diverse instruments and players, blockchain networks need orchestration to manage and facilitate inter-chain communication, transactions, and data sharing.

Orchestration enables multiple blockchains to work together seamlessly, allowing users to perform actions across different networks without needing to understand the complexities involved. It is a crucial component for building a scalable, interconnected blockchain ecosystem that can leverage the strengths of various networks.

## TCP/IP of Blockchains

The idea of orchestration can be likened to the TCP/IP protocol suite in the traditional internet. Just as TCP/IP enables different computers and networks to communicate over the internet, orchestration protocols allow different blockchains to interact.

In this analogy:

- **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) is responsible for ensuring reliable communication and data transmission between computers, akin to how Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) ensures reliable and secure message passing between blockchains.
- **IP** (Internet Protocol) routes and addresses packets of data to ensure they reach the correct destination. Similarly, orchestration mechanisms in blockchain manage the routing and addressing of transactions and messages between networks.

By providing a standardized method for inter-chain communication, orchestration protocols like IBC are often referred to as the "TCP/IP of blockchains," enabling interoperability across different blockchain networks.

## Motivations

The motivations for developing robust orchestration solutions in blockchain are numerous:

- **Interoperability**: Different blockchains often serve different purposes. For example, Bitcoin focuses on being a decentralized currency, while Ethereum allows for smart contracts. Orchestration enables these different chains to interact and leverage each other's strengths.
- **Scalability**: As more blockchains are created, the need for them to work together smoothly becomes more pressing. Orchestration provides a scalable solution for managing and coordinating inter-chain activities.

- **User Experience**: Users want seamless experiences. Orchestration hides the complexities of interacting with multiple chains, making it easier for users to engage with blockchain applications without needing to understand the underlying protocols.

- **Security**: Proper orchestration ensures that cross-chain operations are secure and that the integrity of transactions and data is maintained.

# Key components

To understand how orchestration works in a blockchain environment, it's essential to look at its key components:

## Chain Object

The chain object is a fundamental building block in orchestration. It represents an abstraction of a blockchain, encapsulating all the necessary details to interact with it, such as its endpoints, account structures, and transaction formats. This abstraction allows developers to interact with the blockchain without needing to understand its internal workings.

```js
orchestrator.getChain('agoric');
```

In order, to get access to the chain object, we need `orchestrator` object. Using the `orchestrator` object, we can extract a chain(In cosmos ecosystem).

## Create Chain Accounts

Creating chain accounts is a fundamental step in interacting with a blockchain. Each blockchain typically requires its own set of credentials or key pairs to authorize transactions and interact with the network. In the context of orchestration, the process of creating chain accounts involves generating the necessary cryptographic keys and associating them with the desired blockchain network through the chain object.

In the Agoric SDK, for example, creating a chain account might look like this:

```js
// Code ...
```

## Query blockchains

Querying blockchains is essential for retrieving information such as account balances, transaction history, smart contract state, and more. The orchestration framework must provide a uniform interface for querying different blockchains, despite the underlying differences in their APIs and data formats.

For instance, querying the balance of an account on a blockchain might look like this:

```js
// Code ...
```

## Send Transactions

Sending transactions is a critical function of any blockchain orchestration framework. Transactions could be anything from transferring assets, invoking smart contracts, or even triggering cross-chain operations.

The orchestration layer needs to handle the nuances of each blockchain's transaction format, signature requirements, and broadcasting mechanisms. Here's a basic example of sending a transaction using the chain object:

```js
// Code ...
```

# Examples

# Under the Hood: How Orchestration Works

To understand how orchestration frameworks work under the hood, we need to look at the underlying technologies that make cross-chain communication possible.

## Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

The IBC protocol is a standardized framework for inter-chain communication, primarily used in the Cosmos ecosystem but applicable to any blockchain that implements the protocol. IBC allows different blockchains to securely send messages and transactions to each other.

## Relayers

Relayers are off-chain processes that facilitate the communication between blockchains in the IBC protocol. They monitor the state of the blockchains involved and relay packets of information, such as transaction data, from one blockchain to another. Relayers play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of cross-chain operations.

## Channels

Channels are pathways through which blockchains communicate over IBC. Each channel is associated with a pair of blockchains and a specific application logic. For example, one channel might be dedicated to token transfers, while another might handle smart contract invocations.

## Connections

Connections are the underlying transport layer in the IBC protocol. They establish the secure, authenticated links between blockchains over which channels operate. Connections ensure that messages are transmitted reliably and securely, preserving the integrity of cross-chain interactions.

## Asynchronous Flow

Blockchain transactions and messages are typically asynchronous, meaning they do not require an immediate response and can be processed at different times. Orchestration frameworks must handle this asynchronicity, ensuring that messages are correctly sequenced and that eventual consistency is achieved across different blockchains.

In practical terms, this might involve tracking transaction confirmations, handling retries in case of failures, and managing state across different networks. The orchestration layer abstracts these complexities, allowing developers to work with an easier, more synchronous-like interface while the framework handles the asynchronous nature of blockchain operations.

## Vows

In the Agoric ecosystem, "Vows" are a concept similar to JavaScript's Promises but tailored for distributed systems and smart contracts. Vows represent a commitment to a future result that might depend on asynchronous operations across multiple chains.

For example, a vow might represent the promise of a token transfer from one blockchain to another. As the operation progresses, the vow gets resolved, updated, or rejected based on the outcome. Vows provide a powerful abstraction for managing asynchronous workflows in a distributed environment.
