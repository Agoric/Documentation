## The Platform
Building on 30 years of experience, Agoric is developing a secure distributed ocap platform for smart contracts and market-oriented programming. Our platform supports the development of smart contracts and market institutions across many different scales, from large public blockchains to small two-party contracts.

Our ocap platform consists of:

- A robust architecture for building secure smart contracts.
- A foundation in JavaScript for maximum reach.
- A cryptographic routing fabric for inter-chain interoperability.
- A library of market abstractions and a framework for securely composing them.
- A framework for secure user interaction.
