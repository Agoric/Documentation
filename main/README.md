## Features section
features:
  - title: Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol (ERTP)
    details: Agoric empowers individuals to securely execute transactions, establish new markets, and craft novel patterns of exchange — without centralized control.

  - title: Better security architecture with OCaps
    details: Agoric uses an object-capability model (OCaps) security architecture, in which access to a programming object itself is the authority to use the object.

  - title: Securely Create and Transfer Assetss
    details: All kinds of digital assets can be easily created, but importantly, they can be transferred in exactly the same ways, with exactly the same security properties.

## The Platform
Building on 30 years of experience, Agoric is developing a secure distributed ocap platform for smart contracts and market-oriented programming. Our platform supports the development of smart contracts and market institutions across many different scales, from large public blockchains to small two-party contracts.

Our OCaps platform consists of:

- A robust architecture for building secure smart contracts.
- A foundation in JavaScript for maximum reach.
- A cryptographic routing fabric for inter-chain interoperability.
- A library of market abstractions and a framework for securely composing them.
- A framework for secure user interaction.

## Build Beta Dapps

This documentation site goes into detail about the Agoric system. For Beta, we recommend everyone begin by [getting started](/getting-started/beta.md) with a deployed application as a user. You'll start by getting your wallet set up, including getting some mock assets to play with. Then you'll be able to play experiment the deployed application, see how it works, and starting envisioning your own Dapp.
