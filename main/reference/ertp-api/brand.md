# Brand Object
A **Brand** identifies the asset type of the **[Issuer](./issuer.md)** and **[Mint](./mint.md)**
associated with the **Brand**. A given **Brand** has a one-to-one relationship
with an **Issuer** and a **Mint**, and a one-to-many relationship with **[Purses](./purse.md)**
and **[Payments](./payment.md)**.

For example, if you were to create a **Brand** that uses *Quatloos*:
- There would be exactly one *Quatloos* **Issuer**.
- There would be exactly one *Quatloos* **Mint**.
- There could be any number of **Purses** that could hold *Quatloos*.
- There could be any number of **Payments** that could hold *Quatloos*.

All of these relationships are unchangeable. For example, if a **Mint** is created that makes 
new *Quatloos*, it can never create non-*Quatloos* assets. Similarly, the *Quatloos* **Brand** 
will always be associated with 
the *Quatloos* **Mint** and *Quatloos* **Issuer**.

## aBrand.isMyIssuer(allegedIssuer)
- **allegedIssuer** **[Issuer](./issuer.md)**
- Returns: **Boolean**

Returns **true** if *allegedIssuer* is the **Brand**'s **Issuer**. Returns **false** if it's not.

Note that a **Brand** from an untrusted source can misrepresent its association with
an **Issuer**. The claim should be cross-checked using the **Issuer's**
[**anIssuer.getBrand()**](./issuer.md#anissuer-getbrand) method for mutual agreement.

```js
const isIssuer = brand.isMyIssuer(issuer);
```

## aBrand.getAllegedName()
- Returns: **String**

Returns the alleged name of the **Brand**.

An alleged name is a human-readable string name of a type of digital asset.
It should not be trusted as accurate since there is no public registry or 
expectation of uniqueness. This means there can be multiple **[Issuers](./issuer.md)**, **[Mints](./mint.md)**, or **Brands** 
with the same alleged name, and thus the name by itself does not uniquely 
identify an **Issuer**. Rather, the **Brand** object does that.

To put it another way, nothing stops different people from creating multiple 
**Issuers** with the alleged name *Quatloos*, but that doesn't make any of them the 
*Quatloos* **Issuer**. The alleged name is just a human readable string which is 
helpful for debugging.
```js
const name = brand.getAllegedName();
```

## aBrand.getDisplayInfo()
- Returns: **[DisplayInfo](./ertp-data-types.md#displayinfo)**

Returns the **DisplayInfo** associated with the **Brand**. 

You use a **DisplayInfo** object at the dapp and UI levels to correctly 
display **[Amounts](./ertp-data-types.md#amount)**. For fungible tokens, use the **decimalPlaces** property
to display their value in the commonly used denomination, rather than 
the smallest denomination used for financial accounting (e.g.,
displaying in dollars rather than cents).

```js
const quatloosDisplay = quatloosBrand.getDisplayInfo();
```

## aBrand.getAmountShape()
- Returns: **[AmountShape](./ertp-data-types.md#amountshape)**

Returns the **AmountShape** for a **Brand** associated with a non-fungible asset.
