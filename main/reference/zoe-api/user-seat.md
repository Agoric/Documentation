# UserSeat Object

Within Zoe, **seats** are used by contracts and users to access or manipulate offers.
Zoe has two kinds of seats. **[ZCFSeats](./zcfseat.md)**
are used within contracts and with **zcf** methods. **UserSeats** represent offers external to
Zoe and the contract. The party who exercises an **[Invitation](./zoe-data-types.md#invitation)** and sends the **offer()** message
to Zoe gets a **UserSeat** that can check payouts' status or retrieve the result of
processing the offer in the contract. This varies, but examples
are a **String** and an **Invitation** for another seat.

Also, a **UserSeat** can be handed to an agent outside Zoe and the contract, letting
them query or monitor the current state, access the payouts and result,
and, if it's allowed for this seat, call **tryExit()**.

Take care when sharing a **UserSeat**, since it includes authority to (attempt to) exit the seat.

**UserSeat** includes queries for the associated offer's current state
and an operation to request that the offer exit, as follows:

## E(UserSeat).getProposal()
  - Returns: **Promise&lt;ProposalRecord>**

A **Proposal** is represented by a **ProposalRecord**. It is the rules
accompanying the escrow of **[Payments](/reference/ertp-api/payment.md)** dictating what the user expects
to get back from Zoe. It has keys **give**, **want**, and
**exit**. **give** and **want** are records with **[Keywords](./zoe-data-types.md#keyword)** as keys and
**[Amounts](/reference/ertp-api/ertp-data-types.md#amount)** as values. If it is compatible with the contract, the
contract tries to satisfy it. If not, the contract kicks the **seat** out.

Offer safety is always enforced; if kicked out, the user gets back
what they put in. If the contract attempts to satisfy it, they either
get what they asked for or Zoe ensures they get back their deposit.

Example:

```js
const { want, give, exit } = sellerSeat.getProposal();
```

## E(UserSeat).getPayouts()
  - Returns: **Promise&lt;PaymentKeywordRecord>**

A **Payout** is a **[Payment](/reference/ertp-api/payment.md)** that goes to a party in a successful transaction, redirecting
escrowed assets in accordance with the result of the transaction. Returns a **Promise** for a record
containing all the **Payout** **Payments** associated with the **seat**'s offers.


```js
// Record example
const paymentKeywordRecord = {
  FirstPayment: quatloosPayment,
  SecondPayment: moolaPayment,
  //etc.
};
```


## E(UserSeat).getPayout(keyword)
- **keyword** **[Keyword](./zoe-data-types.md#keyword)**
- Returns: **Promise&lt;[Payment](/reference/ertp-api/payment.md)>**

A **Payout** is a **Payment** that goes to a party in a successful transaction, redirecting
escrowed assets in accordance with the result of the transaction. Returns a **Promise** for the **Payout**
**Payment** associated with the *keyword* argument.

## E(UserSeat).getOfferResult()
  - Returns: **Promise&lt;OfferResult>**

Returns a **Promise** for an **OfferResult**. The **OfferResult** can be literally anything. 
For example, in tests
for the Automated Refund Dapp, it's the string "The offer was accepted". In
the Covered Call example, it's a call option, which is an assayable **[Invitation](./zoe-data-types.md#invitation)**
to buy the underlying asset. Strings and invitations are the most common things returned.
The value is set by the returned result of the **offerHandlers** function passed
as an argument to **[zcf.makeInvitation()](./zoe-contract-facet.md#zcf-makeinvitation-offerhandler-description-customproperties-proposalshape)**.

## E(UserSeat).hasExited()
  - Returns: **Promise&lt;Boolean>**

Returns **true** if the seat has exited, **false** if it's still active.

## E(UserSeat).tryExit()
  - Returns: None.

Note: Only works if the **seat**'s **proposal** has an **OnDemand** **exit** clause.
Zoe's offer-safety guarantee applies no matter how a **seat**'s interaction with
a contract ends. Under normal
circumstances, the participant might be able to call **tryExit()**, or the
contract might do something explicitly. On exiting, the seat holder
gets its current **[Allocation](./zoe-data-types.md#allocation)** and the **seat** can no longer interact with the contract.


## E(UserSeat).numWantsSatisfied()
- Returns: **Promise&lt;Number>**

Returns a **Promise** for a number which indicates the result of the exited **Proposal**, as described below:

| Number Returned | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The user didn't get what they wanted from the **Proposal**, so their offer was refunded. |
| 1 | The user got what they wanted from the **Proposal**, so their offer is spent & gone. |


## E(UserSeat).getExitSubscriber()
- Returns: **Promise&lt;Subscriber>**

Returns a **Promise** for the **Subscriber** for the seat.


## E(UserSeat).getFinalAllocation()
- Returns: **Promise&lt;[Allocation](./zoe-data-types.md#allocation)>**

Returns a **Promise** for the **Allocation** when the **UserSeat** exits the **proposal**.
