# Agoric Documentation Guide

Agoric provides three main types of documentation, as well as links to
"big picture" presentations and papers and links to our source code on GitHub. This page
describes our documentation structure, where documents are, and when you should use them, 
as well as what order to read them.

Our three main documentation types are:
- **Getting Started**: These are the first things you should
read. They cover what to do to install, set up, and start
using Agoric's smart contract tools. They also introduce those tools and
their underlying concepts and designs.
- **Guides**: These are more detailed and complete descriptions
of our tools and their concepts, designs, and usage. They include
descriptions and examples of how to do various tasks with Agoric
software.
- **Reference**: These are the specs for our APIs and commands,
  as well as checklist tables that specify and explain the
  steps for extended procedures, such as installing Agoric
  software.

Some documents fall into multiple categories. For example, our Agoric
installation document is both a Reference and a Getting Started document.

You should read them in this order:
1. **[Agoric Prerequisites](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/before-using-agoric)**: 
What you need to do before installing Agoric software and installing the Agoric SDK.
2. **[Start a Project](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/start-a-project)**: A
  procedure checklist that walks you through creating a new smart contract 
  project from scratch. 
3. **[ERTP Introduction](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/ertp-introduction)**:
  A Getting Started document that
  briefly explains the concepts and components of Agoric's Electronic
  Rights Transfer Protocol (ERTP) which is the heart of Agoric
  software.
4. **[Zoe Introduction](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/zoe-introduction)**: 
  A Getting Started document that
  briefly explains the concepts and components of Zoe, our reusable smart contract 
  for writing other smart contracts in JavaScript. Zoe implements our guarantee that users either get what they wanted from the
  contract or a full refund of what they put up for it. 
5. **[ERTP Guide](https://agoric.com/documentation/ertp/guide/)**: 
  A detailed description of ERTP concepts, design, components, and commands. 
  Includes examples of command usage. You should also look at the ERTP API 
  documentation, accessible from the ERTP documentation sidebar menu.
6. **[Zoe Guide](https://agoric.com/documentation/zoe/guide/)**: 
  A detailed description of Zoe concepts, design, components, and commands. 
  Includes examples of command usage. You should also look at the Zoe API 
  documentation, accessible from the Zoe documentation sidebar menu.

When needed, refer to the **[ERTP API Reference](https://agoric.com/documentation/ertp/api/)**, **[Zoe API
Reference](https://agoric.com/documentation/zoe/api/)**, and 
**[Agoric CLI Guide](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/agoric-cli-guide/)** for details about 
their respective commands. 

To familiarize yourself with working Agoric smart contracts, take a look at our 
**[Sample Contracts](https://agoric.com/documentation/zoe/guide/contracts/)**. 

We also have an **[Agoric Glossary](https://agoric.com/documentation/glossary/)** for terms we've given Agoric-context
definitions to (i.e. what does *mint* mean in an Agoric context?).

For more about Agoric's ideas, plans, and goals, see our **[Learn More](https://agoric.com/)**
page. It has links to Agoric's company homepage and various documents and 
videos you may find useful, such as conference talks, white papers, 
conference papers, etc.

Finally, we have links to the ultimate documentation; the **[GitHub
repositories](https://github.com/Agoric/)** for the code that defines the Agoric SDK.
