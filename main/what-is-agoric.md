# What is Agoric?

Agoric is a layer 1, proof-of-stake public blockchain designed to enable developers to rapidly build safe smart contracts in the most popular programming language on the planet, JavaScript.

The Agoric blockchain and crypto ecosystem is the smart contract platform that can quickly bring millions of developers to the DeFi frontier. Agoric’s hardened JavaScript makes blockchain programming accessible to the 10+ million JavaScript developers. Hardened JavaScript provides the safe, stable environment that developers need to build, deploy, and operate sophisticated Dapps, NFTs, and DeFi markets. The Agoric public blockchain, part of the Cosmos ecosystem, is built upon the battle-tested Tendermint Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus system with native IBC support. Moreover, the Agoric programming model, supported by our native market infrastructure, is designed to enable the formation of a cryptoeconomic standard library with the same exponential composability that led to the explosive growth of the Node.js, React.js, and other JavaScript ecosystems.

Beyond just the JavaScript programming language, the Agoric platform introduces Zoe, a “first of its kind” platform service that enables safe economic composition between smart contracts. Zoe brings to web3 developers on the Agoric platform the kind of modern, pluggable component framework that has dominated web2 development.
