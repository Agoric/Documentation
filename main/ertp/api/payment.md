# Payment
A `payment` holds digital assets that are in transit or 
expected to soon be in transit. It can be deposited in `purses`, 
split into or combined with multiple `payments`, and claimed (getting
an exclusive `payment` and revoking access from anyone else). 

A `payment` is linear, meaning either a `payment` has its full
original balance, or it is used up entirely. You cannot partially use a
`payment`. In other words, if a `payment` is 10 Quatloos, you can't
take out, say, 3 Quatloos from it, leaving the `payment` with 7 Quatloos.

However, you can split a `payment` into multiple `payments`, for example 
into two new `payments` of 3 Quatloos and 7 Quatloos.
The `split()` operation *burns* (destroys) the original 10 Quatloos `payment`.

`Payments` are often received from other actors. Since they are not self-verifying,
you cannot trust `payments`. To get the verified balance of a `payment`, use the `issuer` 
associated with the `payment`'s `brand`: `issuer.getAmountOf(payment)`.

To convert a `payment` into a new `purse`: 
1. Get the `payment`'s trusted `issuer`. 
2. Use the `issuer` to create an empty `purse` for that `brand`.
3. Deposit the `payment` into the new `purse`. 

`purse.deposit(payment)` burns the `payment`.

## payment.getAllegedBrand()
- Returns: `{Brand}`

Get the allegedBrand, indicating the kind of digital asset this `payment` purports to be, and which `issuer` to use 
with it. Because `payments` are not trusted, any method calls on `payments` 
should be treated with suspicion and verified elsewhere.

```js
const payment = quatloosMint.mintPayment(quatloosAmountMath.make(10));
//Should return 'quatloos'
const allegedBrand = payment.getAllegedBrand();
```
