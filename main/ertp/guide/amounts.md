# Amounts

`amounts` describe digital assets. An amount has two parts: the `brand` and the `value`. From the brand you learn the kind of digital asset, and from the value you learn "how much" or "how many". For example, in the phrase "5 bucks", "bucks" takes the role of the brand and the value is 5. Amounts can describe fungible and non-fungible digital assets. Amounts are pass-by-copy and can be made by and sent to anyone.
