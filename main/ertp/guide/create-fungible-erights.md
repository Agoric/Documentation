# Creating a fungible eright with ERTP

## Definition of "fungible"

A **fungible** asset means that different elements of this asset are interchangeable.
Currencies are interchangeable: if you have 10 one-dollar notes laying around and decide
to take 5 of them, you do not care which 5 you get. They're all "the same" as far 
as counting value goes.

This would not be the case for 10 house ownership rights each designating a different house.
House ownership rights are not fungible, they are **specific**.


## Creating a fungible asset with ERTP

### Creating and sending the asset

In ERTP, digital assets are created by a [`mint`](./issuer#mint). Having access to the mint
gives you the power to create more digital assets of the same type at
will. For instance, let's say we want to create a new community
currency called 'BaytownBucks'.
You would first install the [ertp JavaScript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agoric/ertp)
(`npm install @agoric/ertp`) and then:

```js
import makeIssuerKit from '@agoric/ertp';
import harden from '@agoric/harden';

const { mint: baytownBucksMint, issuer } = makeIssuerKit('BaytownBucks');
```

Great! Now let's use our mint to create 1000 new BaytownBucks.

```js
const baytownBucks = issuer.getAmountMath().make;
const payment = baytownBucksMint.mintPayment(baytownBucks(1000));
```

The act of minting created 1000 BaytownBucks and stored them together in a 
`payment`.

[`Payment`s](./issuer#payments) are objects that are meant to be exchanged. On the 
other hand, if you want to store the asset for some time before exchanging it, you can 
store it in a [`Purse`](./issuer#purses).
Let's store our payment in a purse!

```js
const myPurse = issuer.makeEmptyPurse();
console.log(myPurse.getCurrentAmount().value); // 0

myPurse.deposit(payment);
console.log(myPurse.getCurrentAmount().value); // 1000
```


Let's distribute the BaytownBucks to members of the community. To send
money in ERTP, we withdraw [`payments`](./mint.html#payments) from purses.

```js
const paymentForAlice = myPurse.withdraw(baytownBucks(35));
```

Now let's send the payment to Alice as a message:

```js
alice.receivePayment(paymentForAlice);
```

Here `alice` is an object reference, and we can call her `receivePayment`
to ask her to receive this payment. Alice's methods are entirely up to her, 
and are not part of ERTP.


### Receiving the asset

On Alice's side, she creates a `purse` for `baytownBucks` and gets ready to receive payments.
For this to happen, Alice needs access to `baytownBucksAssay`.
However, she does not need access to `baytownBucksMint`.
If she had access to it, she could create baytownBucks herself by calling `baytownBucksMint.mint`.

```js
const myBaytownBucksPurse = issuer.makeEmptyPurse();

console.log(myBaytownBucksPurse.getCurrentAmount().value); // 0

const alice = {
    receivePayment(allegedBaytownBucksPayment) {
        myBaytownBucksPurse.deposit(allegedBaytownBucksPayment)
    }
}
```

And just like that, when `alice.receivePayment(paymentForAlice)` from earlier 
is called, Alice accumulates the 35 payment in her purse.

When alice wants to exchange something for 13 BaytownBucks, she creates a payment from her purse:
```js
const baytownBucks = issuer.getAmountMath().make;
const payment = myBaytownBucksPurse.withdraw(baytownBucks(13));
```

This came naturally without having to express "which" 13 she wanted to withdraw.

And this is how fungible assets work in ERTP!


## Security Properties

How does Alice know that she got paid real money? She could have been
sent fake money, or she could have been sent money that was
[double-spent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending).

When alice receives an alleged payment, she calls `myBaytownBucksPurse.deposit`.
This function first checks that its argument is a genuine payment object of the same
issuer as the purse. If it's the case, the amount is transferred in full
from the payment to the purse. If there is a mismatch, the method throws an error.

After the call to `deposit` succeeds, ERTP guarantees that:
- the payment object is now empty
- the purse contains the full content of the payment

After the call to `deposit` throws, ERTP guarantees that:
- the alleged payment is in the same state as before the call
- the purse is in the same state as before the call

The issuer is associated with the mint, but
the issuer is the public-facing version that is accessible to anyone.
By holding the reference to a mint, you can mint more tokens. By
holding a reference to the issuer for a mint, you can check that a
payment is valid and exclusively claim it 
in a new payment to yourself (`issuer.claim`) or deposit it in a purse of 
yours (`myBaytownBucksPurse.deposit`).
