# Units
Units are the canonical description of tradable goods. They are
manipulated by [mints](./mint), and represent the goods and currency carried by
purses and payments. They can be used to represent things like
currency, stock, and the abstract right to participate in a particular
exchange.

## Labeled extents
Units are labeled extents. To be specific, units are a record with two
parts: a [label](./label), which identifies an [assay](./assay), and an [extent](./extent). The balance
of a purse or payment is in units. For example, the balance of a purse
might be 3 bucks, written in units as:

```js
{
  label: {
    allegedName: 'bucks',
    assay: bucksAssay,
  },
  extent: 3,
}
```
