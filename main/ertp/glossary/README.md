# ERTP Glossary

## AllegedName
Human-readable name of a kind of rights. The alleged name should
not be trusted as an accurate depiction, since it is provided by
the maker of the mint and could be deceptive, but is useful for debugging and double-checking.

The AllegedName must be a string.

## AmountMath
AmountMath executes the logic of how amounts are changed when digital assets are merged, separated, or otherwise manipulated. For example, a deposit of 2 bucks into a purse that already has 3 bucks gives a new balance of 5 bucks. An empty purse has 0 bucks. AmountMath relies heavily on polymorphic MathHelpers, which manipulate the unbranded portion.

## Amounts
Amounts are the canonical description of tradable goods. They are manipulated
by issuers and mints, and represent the goods and currency carried by purses and
payments. They can be used to represent things like currency, stock, and the
abstract right to participate in a particular exchange.

An amount is composed of a `Brand` with an `Extent`.

## AssetHolder
Purses and Payments are AssetHolders.

## Brand
Identifies the kind of issuer.

## ERTP
Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol - Agoric's fungible and
nonfungible token standard that uses object capabilities to enforce
access control. Instead of having to prove ownership of a
corresponding private key, in the world of object capabilities, if
your program has a reference to an object, it can call methods on that
object. If it doesn't have a reference, it can't. For more on object
capabilities, see [Chip Morningstar's
post](http://habitatchronicles.com/2017/05/what-are-capabilities/).

## Extent
Extents describe the extent of something that can be owned or shared: How much, how many, or description of unique asset. (Pixel(3,2), $3 or ‘Right to occupy on Tuesdays’). Fungible extents are normally represented by natural numbers. Other extents may be represented as strings naming a particular right, or an arbitrary object that sensibly represents the rights at issue.

Extent must be Comparable.

## Issuer
Can create empty purses and payments, but it cannot mint new amounts. The issuer can also transform payments (splitting payments, combining payments, burning payments, and claiming payments exclusively). The issuer should be gotten from a trusted source and then relied upon as the decider of whether an untrusted payment is valid.

## MathHelpers
Arithmetic on extents. MathHelpers are used by AmountMath to do their extent arithmetic, and then brand the result, making a new amount.

## Mint
The admin facet of the issuer, and the only object with the authority
to mint new digital assets.

## Purse
An [AssetHolder](#assetholder). Purses hold amounts of certain rights issued by Mints, specifically amounts that are _stationary_. Purses can transfer part of the balance they hold in a payment, which has a narrower interface.

## Payment
An [AssetHolder](#assetholder). Payments hold amounts of certain rights issued by Mints, specifically amounts that are in _transit_. Amounts from payments can be deposited in purses, but otherwise, the entire amount is available when the payment is transferred. Payments can be converted to Purses.
