# What is Agoric?

Agoric is a blockchain and smart contract platform in the Cosmos ecosystem for building decentralized software with a familiar component framework and advanced safety features, all in JavaScript to make web3 more accessible to millions of developers and users. Developers can apply their existing skills and experience to build world-class, consumer-ready decentralized applications. With a growing ecosystem of tools, services, and over 60 cross-chain connections (and counting!), Agoric is the gateway to web3 for developers and explorers alike.

Read the Agoric Whitepaper

The Agoric platform is the realization of decades of research on decentralized computing and the open web: a platform to pave the way for a future with a vibrant online world where billions of people cooperate and interact without interference safely and freely. The smart contract framework Zoe, Agoric Virtual Machine, and built-in interchain connectivity combine to provide a new level of user safety and cross-chain use cases at the platform level–all in JavaScript.

## History
Agoric was founded by early cypherpunks and supporters of the free, open, decentralized web; Dean Tribble, Mark Miller, Bill Tulloh, and Brian Warner. As early as the 1980’s, the creators of Agoric recognized the benefits inherent in these kinds of applications and knew that other developers would see them, too. Blockchain technology provided the missing ingredient and, wanting devs to have better access to this new decentralized technology, Agoric Systems Operating Company (OpCo) was founded in 2018 to begin building a practical, accessible platform for smart contract development.

Since the whitepaper was published, Agoric OpCo along with a community of developers, validators, and BLD stakers worked together to launch the Agoric chain and brought it to mainnet. Along the way:

- Mainnet-1 launched with the Inter Protocol MVP, the first production use of the Agoric VM and Zoe.

- Mainnet-1B launched with Inter Protocol Vaults going live
The chain moved to Mainnet-2, ready for permissioned third-party launches

- MetaMask Snaps Launched with HardenedJS as a core safety component

- stATOM was added as an option for Vaults, the first collateral asset onboarded by the community

## The Agoric Advantages
Agoric has several unique features that set it apart from other smart contract platforms and many strengths that make it a competitive candidate for application developers.

### JavaScript Smart Contracts and Web3 Development
The Agoric smart contract platform provides the same sort of programmability found in familiar JavaScript workflows, letting developers leverage their existing skills. Only Agoric provides a modern component framework with advanced safety properties for blockchain development in JavaScript. 

With Agoric, devs can build powerful web3 applications using a familiar, composable approach. Agoric smart contracts are JavaScript functions - looking to list assets for sale? Try sellItems. Want to be able to trade those assets instead? There’s barterExchange for that. If you’ve built applications with React or Node, you’ve already got a solid foundation for learning to build on Agoric.

### Safety First Approach
Agoric is designed from the bottom-up with developer and user safety in mind. You write applications and smart contracts on Agoric using Hardened JavaScript, the JavaScript you know and love with safety features so it works how you expect. This protects developers by helping reduce the likelihood of certain classes of common vulnerabilities, and boosts user confidence in the reliability of the application.

The Agoric smart contract framework, Zoe, is used to run code on-chain and credibly trade assets. Zoe enables novel safety features like Offer Safety and Payout Liveness, two protections unique to Agoric that assure users they’ll get what they want out of a transaction or it doesn’t happen.

## The Agoric Ecosystem
The Agoric ecosystem is constantly expanding and includes wallets, institutional-grade custodians, exchanges, cross-chain DeFi, NFTs, and more. Navigate a dynamically updated list of ecosystem resources at the Agoric Ecosystem page.

### Inter Protocol (IST)
Inter Protocol is a community-organized, decentralized application launched on the Agoric chain that notably implements the Inter Stable Token (IST), the native fee token on the Agoric chain. Inter Protocol also includes Vaults for over-collateralized minting of IST against assets like ATOM or stATOM, and Parity Stability Modules which enable swaps between IST and other stable tokens at a set ratio. 

## Dual-token Economy
BLD is the native token of the Agoric chain, a foundational asset to the network that enables staking, voting, and governance activity within the Agoric ecosystem. It is supported across various platforms, including self-custody wallets, institutional custodians, decentralized exchanges, and centralized exchanges​​.

IST is an over-collateralized, risk-managed stable token designed for broad use across the Cosmos and interchain ecosystems. Its primary aim is to maintain parity with the US dollar, ensuring accessibility and stability in a volatile market​​.

This dual-token economy makes Agoric one of the few chains where users can participate in both the growth of the stable token and the smart contract ecosystem at the same time.

## BLD and Staking on Agoric

Staking is a fundamental part of proof of stake consensus mechanisms. On Agoric, staking BLD contributes to securing the network and validating transactions. Stakers are rewarded through BLD issuance and can participate in on-chain governance to help shape the future of Agoric.

### Set up a Wallet 

Set up a wallet that accepts BLD and supports staking. Follow our guides in how to transfer your BLD into your wallet of choice.

### Stake and Delegate

Staking is handled through your wallet’s user interface, so specific steps will vary by provider. From your wallet web or mobile app, select the Staking option for your BLD and the amount you want to stake. You’ll then select a validator to delegate your BLD stake to.

### Monitor your Stake and Vote

Once your stake has been deposited, you can add to your stake, withdraw BLD, and claim rewards through your wallet provider. You can also vote through the wallet UI during the voting period of governance proposals.

## IST Across the Interchain
IST is not just another stable token; it is intricately woven into the fabric of the Agoric economy. As the native fee token for the Agoric chain, IST plays a critical role in facilitating transactions and network operations​​. Its integration into the Agoric ecosystem enhances the platform's functionality and appeal to a broader range of users and developers.

IST stands out for its broad availability to all chains within the growing Cosmos and IBC ecosystems. This universal accessibility positions IST as a key facilitator of interchain interactions and transactions, furthering the vision of a connected and interoperable blockchain environment​​. 

Learn more about using IST on the Inter Protocol website.
