# AutoSwap

<Zoe-Version/>

An AutoSwap is like a swap, except instead of having to find a
matching offer, an offer is always matched against the existing
liquidity pool. The AutoSwap contract checks whether your offer will
keep the [constant product
invariant](https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/uniswap/uniswap/x-y-k.pdf)
before accepting.

An implementation of [UniSwap](https://uniswap.org/).

## Initialization

Create an instance of the Autoswap code, and receive an invite that
when used, will let you add liquidity to Autoswap.

```js
const issuerKeywordRecord = harden({
  TokenA: moolaIssuer,
  TokenB: simoleanIssuer,
});

const addLiquidityInvite = await E(zoe).makeInstance(
  autoswapInstallationHandle,
  issuerKeywordRecord,
);
```

## Adding liquidity to the pool

We can contribute to the Autoswap liquidity pool by making an offer by
using an addLiquidityInvite. For instance, let's say that Alice
creates a proposal with the associated payments of moola and simoleans
and escrows them:

```js
// Alice adds liquidity
// 10 moola = 5 simoleans at the time of the liquidity adding
// aka 2 moola = 1 simolean

const moola = moolaAmountMath.make;
const simoleans = simoleanAmountMath.make;
const liquidity = liquidityAmountMath.make;

const aliceProposal = harden({
  give: {
    TokenA: moola(10),
    TokenB: simolean(5)
  },
  want: { Liquidity: liquidity(10) },
  exit: { onDemand: null },
]);

const alicePayments = {
  TokenA: aliceMoolaPayment,
  TokenB: aliceSimoleanPayment
}

const {
  outcome,
  payout: aliceAddLiquidityPayoutP,
} = await E(zoe).offer(addLiquidityInvite, aliceProposal, alicePayments);

```
She is able to ensure that she will get a minimum number of liquidity
tokens back by specifying a rule for the liquidity token slot with
`want`. In this case, Alice is stating that she wants at least
10 liquidity tokens back.

## Making a swap offer

Let's say that Bob wants to use the moola<->simolean autoswap
to exchange 2 moola. First he will check the price using the public
API:

#### Public API:
1. `getCurrentPrice`
2. `getLiquidityIssuer`
3. `getPoolAllocation`
4. `makeInvite`

```js
const simoleanAmounts = E(publicAPI).getCurrentPrice(harden({ TokenA: moola(2) }));
```
By using `getCurrentPrice`, he learns that the current price for 2 moola is 1
simolean. Because other people may make offers before Bob does, he
can't rely on this price. However, he can make his offer conditional
on getting at least 1 simolean back. If the price has moved, he will
get a refund:

```js
 const bobMoolaForSimProposal = harden({
  want: { TokenB: simoleans(1) },
  give: { TokenA: moola(2) },
});
```

Now Bob uses the publicAPI to get an invite specifically for swapping.

```js
const swapInvite = await E(publicAPI).makeSwapInvite();
```

He escrows 2 moola with Zoe and uses his invite to make an offer:

```js
const bobMoolaForSimPayments = harden({ TokenA: bobMoolaPayment });

const { outcome, payout: bobPayoutP } = await E(zoe).offer(
  swapInvite,
  bobMoolaForSimProposal,
  bobMoolaForSimPayments,
);
```

Now Bob can get his payout:

```js
const bobPayout = await bobPayoutP;

const bobMoolaPayout1 = await bobPayout.TokenA;
const bobSimoleanPayout1 = await bobPayout.TokenB;
```

## Removing Liquidity

If Alice wants to remove liquidity and get moola and simoleans back,
she can do that by making a new proposal and escrowing a payment of
liquidity tokens:

```js
const aliceRemoveLiquidityInvite = await E(publicAPI).makeRemoveLiquidityInvite();

const aliceRemoveLiquidityProposal = harden({
  give: { Liquidity: liquidity(10) },
});

const {
  outcome: removeLiquidityResult,
  payout: aliceRemoveLiquidityPayoutP,
} = await E(zoe).offer(
  aliceRemoveLiquidityInvite,
  aliceRemoveLiquidityProposal,
  harden({ Liquidity: liquidityPayout }),
);

const aliceRemoveLiquidityPayout = await aliceRemoveLiquidityPayoutP;

const aliceMoolaPayout = await aliceRemoveLiquidityPayout.TokenA;
const aliceSimoleanPayout = await aliceRemoveLiquidityPayout.TokenB;
const aliceLiquidityPayout = await aliceRemoveLiquidityPayout.Liquidity;
```
