# Zoe Pre-Built Contracts

<Zoe-Version/>

While Zoe provides the means to build custom smart contracts, there is a good chance you will
want to use one that follows a commonly-used structure. Therefore, we currently provide several
pre-built contracts that can be imported and run on Zoe:

## Oracles

- [Oracle Contract](./oracle.md) - the low-level oracle contract that
  can be used for querying [Chainlink
  oracles](https://docs.chain.link/docs/request-and-receive-data#config)
  or other oracles. 

- [PriceAuthority](/zoe/guide/price-authority.md): To use an price
  oracle in your own contract, we recommend using the `priceAuthority`
  higher-level abstraction.

## DeFi Contracts

These contracts create various sorts of financial instruments.


- [Call Spread](./callSpread.md) - Creates a pair of fully collateralized call spread
  options as ERTP assets. They can be used as such in other contracts.
- [Loan Contract](./loan.md) - a basic collateralized loan contract.
- [Covered Call](./covered-call.md) - Creates a call option, which is the right
  to buy an underlying asset.
- [OTC Desk](./otc-desk.md) - A contract for giving quotes that can be
  exercised. The quotes are guaranteed to be exercisable because they
  are actually options with the underlying assets escrowed.

## Uniswap-like Constant Product AMMs

- [Autoswap](./autoswap.md) - An automated market maker (implementating Uniswap v1) that
  can always trade between the two currencies in its liquidity pool.
- [Multipool Autoswap](./multipoolAutoswap.md) - An automated market maker implementing
  Uniswap v1. It has multiple liquidity pools and can trade between any pair of funded
  currencies.

## Generic Sales/Trading Contracts

These contracts involve trading or selling ERTP digital assets.

- [Sell Items](./sell-items.md) - A generic sales contract, mostly
  used for selling NFTs for money.
- [Atomic Swap](./atomic-swap.md) - A basic trade of digital assets between two parties.
- [Barter Exchange](./barter-exchange.md) - An exchange with an order book that allows all
  kinds of goods to be offered for explicit barter swaps.
- [Second-price Auction](./second-price-auction.md) - An auction in which the highest bidder wins
  and pays the second-highest bid. This version doesn't conceal the bids (an essential aspect
  of second price auctions), therefore, <b>it should not be used in production.</b>
- [Simple Exchange](./simple-exchange.md) - A basic exchange with an order book for one asset,
  priced in a second asset.

## Governance

- [Escrow To Vote](./escrow-to-vote.md) - A coin voting contract in which
  votes are weighted by the escrowed governance tokens.

## Minting

- [Mint Payments](./mint-payments.md) - An example of minting fungible
  tokens.
- [Mint and Sell NFTs](./mint-and-sell-nfts.md) - A contract that
  mints NFTs and sells them through a separate sales contract.

## Misc

- [Use Obj Example](./use-obj-example.md) - An example of how you
  might associate the ability to take an action with ownership of a
  particular digital asset. In this case, you can color a pixel if you
  own the NFT for the pixel.

## Trivial Examples

- [Automatic Refund](./automatic-refund.md) - A trivial contract that
  gives the user back what they put in.
