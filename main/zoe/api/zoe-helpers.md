# ZoeHelpers

ZoeHelpers are functions that extract common contract code and
patterns into reusable helpers.

All of the ZoeHelper methods are described below. To use any of them, import
it directly from `@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport/`. For example, the following 
imports the two ZoeHelpers `assertIssuerKeywords()` and `assertProposalShape()`:
```js
import {
  assertIssuerKeywords,
  assertProposalShape,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';
```
Note that almost all ZoeHelpers require `zcf`, a `ContractFacet` as a first argument.
ZoeHelpers are contract helpers, in that they are useful to contract code. Contracts are started up by Zoe, 
and `zcf` is passed in as a parameter to `start()`. 

## assertIssuerKeywords(zcf, keywords)
- `zcf` `{ContractFacet}` 
- `keywords` `{Array <String>}`

This method always takes `zcf` as its first argument.

Checks that keywords submitted by the contract instance creator
match what the contract expects. Throws if incorrect or if there are
missing or extra keywords. The keywords order is irrelevant.

```js
import {
  assertIssuerKeywords,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';

// proposals for this contract instance use keywords 'Asset' and 'Price'
assertIssuerKeywords(zcf, harden(['Asset', 'Price']));
```

## assertUsesNatMath(zcf, brand)
- `zcf`- `{ContractFacet}`
- `brand` - `{Brand}`

This method always takes `zcf` as its first argument. 

Assert that the `brand` corresponds to an `issuer` that uses `MathKind.NAT`. 
This means the `issuer` creates fungible assets.

If `false` throws with message `issuer must use NAT amountMath`.

```js
import {
  assertUsesNatMath,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';

 assertUsesNatMath(zcf, quatloosBrand);
 ```

## satisfies(zcf, seat, update)
- `zcf`- `{ContractFacet}`
- `seat` - `{ZCFSeat}`
- `update` - `{AmountKeywordRecord}`
- Returns: `{Boolean}` 

This method always takes `zcf` as its first argument.

Returns `true` if an update to a `seat`'s `currentAllocation` satisfies its
`proposal.want`. Note this is half of the offer safety check; 
it does not check if the allocation constitutes a refund.
The update is merged with `currentAllocation` such that
`update`'s values prevail if the keywords are the same. If they
are not the same, the `keyword` and `value` is just added to the `currentAllocation`.

The following example code uses `satisfies()` to define a `satisfiedBy()` comparison
method between two `seats`. It checks if the second `seat` argument's `currentAllocation`
satisfies the first `seat` argument's `proposal.want`. 

It then calls `satisfiedBy()` on both orders of the two `seats`. If both satisfy each other,
it does a swap on them.

```js
import {
  satisfies,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';

const satisfiedBy = (xSeat, ySeat) =>
        satisfies(zcf, xSeat, ySeat.getCurrentAllocation());
if (satisfiedBy(offer, seat) && satisfiedBy(seat, offer)) {
    swap(zcf, seat, offer);
```

## trade(zcf, left, right, leftHasExitedMsg, rightHasExitedMsg)
- `zcf` - `{ContractFacet}`
- `left` - `{SeatGainsLossesRecord}`
- `right` - `{SeatGainsLossesRecord}`
- `leftHasExitedMsg` - `{String}` - Optional
- `rightHasExitedMsg` - `{String}` - Optional
- Returns: void

::: details SeatGainsLossesRecord
 - `seat` - `{ZCFSeat}`
 - `gains` - `{AmountKeywordRecord}`  - what the seat will
gain as a result of this trade
 - `losses` - `{AmountKeywordRecord=}`  - what the seat will give up
   as a result of this trade. Losses is optional, but can only be
   omitted if the keywords for both seats are the same. If losses is
   not defined, the gains of the other seat is subtracted.
:::

**Note**: The `swap()` method is a specific use of `trade()`. In `swap()`, 
for both `seats`, everything a `seat` wants is given to it, having been
taken from the other `seat`. `swap()` exits both `seats`, but `trade()` does not.
- Use `trade()` when any of these are true:
  - The `seats` have different keywords.
  - The `amounts` to be reallocated don't exactly match the wants of the `seats`. 
  - You want to continue to interact with the `seats` after the trade.
- Use `swap()` when all of these are true:
  - Both `seats` use the same keywords.
  - The `seats`' wants can be fulfilled from the other `seat`.
  - No further `seat` interaction is desired.

This method always takes `zcf` as its first argument.

The `left` and `right` arguments are each `SeatGainsLossesRecords`
with `seat`, `gains`, and optional `losses` properties. `gains` and
`losses` are `amountKeywordRecords` describing declaratively what is
added or removed from that `seat`'s allocation.

`trade()` does a trade between the `seats` in `left` and `right`. If the two `seats` can trade, 
it swaps their compatible assets.

Any surplus remains with its original `seat`. For example if `seat` 
A gives 5 Quatloos and `seat` B only wants 3 Quatloos, `seat` A retains 2 Quatloos.

If either of the seats has exited, `trade` throws. `trade` itself does NOT
`fail` or `exit` either seat for any reason.

If the trade fails for reasons other than either seat exiting, it
throws the message `The trade between left and right failed. Please
check the log for more information`. It writes the specific error to
the console.

```js
import {
  trade,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';
trade(
      zcf,
      {
        seat: poolSeat,
        gains: { Central: amountIn },
        losses: { Secondary: amountOut },
        },
      },
      {
        seat: swapSeat,
        gains: { Out: amountOut },
        losses: { In: amountIn },
      },
    );
```

## swap(zcf, leftSeat, rightSeat, leftHasExitedMsg, rightHasExitedMsg)
- `zcf` `{ContractFacet}`
- `leftSeat` `{ZCFSeat}`
- `rightSeat` `{ZCFSeat}`
- `leftHasExitedMsg` - `{String}` - Optional
- `rightHasExitedMsg` - `{String}` - Optional
- Returns: `defaultAcceptanceMsg`

**Note**: The `swap()` method is a specific use of `trade()`. In `swap(),` 
for both `seats`, everything a `seat` wants is given to it, having been
taken from the other `seat`. `swap()` exits both `seats`, but `trade()` does not.
- Use `trade()` when any of these are true:
  - The `seats` have different keywords.
  - The `amounts` to be reallocated don't exactly match the wants of the `seats`. 
  - You want to continue interacting with the `seats` after the trade.
- Use `swap()` when all of these are true:
  - Both `seats` use the same keywords.
  - The `seats`' wants can be fulfilled from the other `seat`.
  - No further `seat` interaction is desired.

This method always takes `zcf` as its first argument.

`leftHasExitedMsg` and `rightHasExitedMsg` are optional and are passed
to `trade` within `swap` to add custom error messages in the case that
either seat has exited.

If the two `seats` can trade, then swap their compatible assets,
exiting both `seats`. It returns the message `The offer has been accepted. 
Once the contract has been completed, please check your payout`.

Any surplus remains with whichever `seat` has the surplus. 
For example if `seat` A gives 5 Quatloos and `seat` B only 
wants 3 Quatloos, `seat` A retains 2 Quatloos.

If the swap fails, no assets transfer, and both left and right `seats` are exited.

```js
import {
  swap,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';

swap(zcf, firstSeat, secondSeat);
```

## swapExact(zcf, leftSeat, rightSeat, leftHasExitedMsg, rightHasExitedMsg)
- `zcf` `{ContractFacet}`
- `leftSeat` `{ZCFSeat}`
- `rightSeat` `{ZCFSeat}`
- `leftHasExitedMsg` - `{String}` - Optional
- `rightHasExitedMsg` - `{String}` - Optional
- Returns: `defaultAcceptanceMsg`

**Note**: `swapExact()` and `swap()` are specific uses of `trade()`. In `swap()` and `swapExact()`,
for both seats, everything a seat wants is given to it, having been
taken from the other seat. `swap()` and `swapExact()` exit both seats, but `trade()` does not.
- Use `trade()` when any of these are true:
  - The `seats` have different keywords.
  - The `amounts` to be reallocated don't exactly match the wants of the `seats`. 
  - You want to continue interacting with the `seats` after the trade.
- Use `swap()` or `swapExact()` when all of these are true:
  - Both `seats` use the same keywords.
  - The `seats`' wants can be fulfilled from the other `seat`.
  - No further `seat` interaction is desired.

This method always takes `zcf` as its first argument.

`leftHasExitedMsg` and `rightHasExitedMsg` are optional and are passed
to `trade()` within `swapExact()` to add custom error messages in the case that
either seat has exited. They default to `the left seat in swapExact() has exited`,
and `the right seat in swapExact() has exited` respectively. 

`exactSwap()` is a special case of `swap()` such that it is successful only
if both seats gain everything they want and lose everything they were willing to give.
It is only good for exact and entire swaps where each
seat wants everything that the other seat has. The benefit of using
this method is that the keywords of each seat do not matter.

If the two `seats` can trade, then swap their compatible assets,
exiting both `seats`. It returns the message `The offer has been accepted. 
Once the contract has been completed, please check your payout`.

If the swap fails, no assets transfer, and both left and right `seats` are exited.

```js
import {
  swapExact,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';

const swapMsg = swapExact(zcf, zcfSeatA, zcfSeatB);
```

## assertProposalShape(seat, expected)
- `seat` `{ZCFSeat}`
- `expected` `{ExpectedRecord}`
- Returns: `{void}`

This is the only ZoeHelper that does **not** take 'zcf' as its first argument.

Check the seat's proposal against an `expected` record that says
what shape of proposal is acceptable.
 
By "shape", we mean the `give`, `want`, and exit rule keywords of the proposal must be equal to 
those in `expected`. Note that exit rule keywords are optional in `expected`. Also, none of the 
values of those keywords are checked.

This `ExpectedRecord` is like a `Proposal`, but the amounts in `want`
and `give` should be `null`; the `exit` clause should specify a rule with
`null` contents. If the client submits a `Proposal` which does not match
these expectations, that `proposal` is rejected (and refunded). 

```js
import {
  assertProposalShape,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';

const sellAssetForPrice = harden({
    give: { Asset: null },
    want: { Price: null },
  });
const sell = seat => {
  assertProposalShape(seat, sellAssetForPrice);
  buySeats = swapIfCanTradeAndUpdateBook(buySeats, sellSeats, seat);
  return 'Trade Successful';
};
```
 
## depositToSeat(zcf, recipientSeat, amounts, payments)
- `zcf` `{ContractFacet }`
- `recipientSeat` `{ZCFSeat}`
- `amounts` `{AmountKeywordRecord}`
- `payments` `{PaymentPKeywordRecord}`
- Returns: `{Promise<string>}`
Deposit payments such that their amounts are reallocated to a seat.
The `amounts` and `payments` records must have corresponding
keywords.

If the seat has exited, aborts with the message `The recipientSeat cannot have exited.`

On success, returns the exported and settable `depositToSeatSuccessMsg` which
defaults to `Deposit and reallocation successful.`
```js
import {
  depositToSeat,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';
await depositToSeat(zcf, zcfSeat, { Dep: quatloos(2n) }, { Dep: quatloosPayment });
```

## withdrawFromSeat(zcf, seat, amounts)
- `zcf` `{ContractFacet }`
- `seat` `{ZCFSeat}`
- `amounts` `{AmountKeywordRecord}`
- Returns: `{Promise<PaymentPKeywordRecord>}`

Withdraw payments from a seat. Note that withdrawing the amounts of
the payments must not and cannot violate offer safety for the seat. The
`amounts` and `payments` records must have corresponding keywords.

If the seat has exited, aborts with the message `The seat cannot have exited.`

Unlike `depositToSeat()`, a `PaymentKeywordRecord` is returned, not a success message.
```js
import {
  withdrawFromSeat,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';
const paymentKeywordRecord = await withdrawFromSeat(zcf, zcfSeat, { With: quatloos(2n) });
```

## saveAllIssuers(zcf, issuerKeywordRecord)
- `zcf` `{ContractFacet}`
- `issuerKeywordRecord` `{IssuerKeywordRecord}`
- Returns: `{Promise<PaymentPKeywordRecord>}`

Save all of the issuers in an `issuersKeywordRecord` to ZCF, using
the method [`zcf.saveIssuer()`](./zoe-contract-facet.md#zcf-saveissuer-issuer-keyword).

This does **not** error if any of the keywords already exist. If the keyword is
already present, it is ignored.

```js
import {
  saveAllIssuers,
} from '@agoric/zoe/src/contractSupport';
await saveAllIssuers(zcf, { G: gIssuer, D: dIssuer, P: pIssuer });
```

## offerTo(zcf, invitation, keywordMapping, proposal, fromSeat, toSeat)
- `zcf` `{ContractFacet}`
- `invitation` `{ERef<Invitation>}`
- `keywordMapping` `{KeywordKeywordRecord=}`
- `proposal` `{Proposal}`
- `fromSeat` `{ZCFSeat}`
- `toSeat` `{ZCFSeat}`
- Returns: `{OfferToReturns}`

`offerTo()` makes an offer from your current contract instance (which
we'll call "contractA") to another contract instance (which we'll call
"contractB"). It withdraws offer payments from the `fromSeat` in
contractA and deposits any payouts in the `toSeat`, also a contractA
seat. Note that `fromSeat` and `toSeat` may be the same seat, which is
the default condition (i.e. `toSeat` is an optional parameter
defaulting to `fromSeat`'s value). `offerTo` can be used to make an
offer from any contract instance to any other contract instance, as
long as the `fromSeat` allows the withdrawal without violating
offer-safety. To be clear, this does mean that contractA and contractB
do not have to be instances of the same contract. 

`zcf` is contractA's Zoe contract facet. The `invitation` parameter is an invitation 
to contractB. The `proposal` parameter is the proposal part of the offer made to contractB.

`keywordMapping` is a record of the keywords used in contractA mapped to the 
keywords for contractB. Note that the pathway to deposit the payout back to
contractA reverses this mapping. It looks like this, where the keywords are
from the contracts indicated by using "A" or "B" in the keyword name.
```js
// Map the keywords in contractA to the keywords in contractB
  const keywordMapping = harden({
    TokenA1: 'TokenB1',
    TokenA2: 'TokenB2',
  });
```

The `OfferToReturns` return value is a promise for an object containing
the `userSeat` for the offer to the other contract, and a promise (`deposited`) 
that resolves when the payout for the offer has been deposited to the `toSeat`. 
Its two properties are:
- `userSeatPromise`: `Promise<UserSeat>` 
- `deposited`: `Promise<AmountKeywordRecord>`

```js
 const { userSeatPromise: autoswapUserSeat, deposited } = zcf.offerTo(
   swapInvitation,
   keywordMapping, // {}
   proposal,
   fromSeat,
   lenderSeat,
 );
```
