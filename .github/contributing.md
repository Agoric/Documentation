# Contributing

This repository contains the Agoric's technical documentation

It is meant to work like a wiki

Here are a couple of rules to follow:
- The content must be written in **English**
- The content must be written in **markdown** (`.md` file extension)

If it's your first contribution, it will go through a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests#about-pull-requests) process, that is, someone will need to review and accept your changes first

When you're trusted enough, you will be granted the right to modify the content directly

If you do not feel confident about the changes you want to make, you can always create a pull request and request a review
